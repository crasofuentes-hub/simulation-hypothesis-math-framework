## Core physical bounds

### Bremermann limit (maximum computational rate per mass-energy)
- Bremermann, H. J. (1962). *Optimization through evolution and recombination*. In: M. C. Yovits, G. T. Jacobi, & G. D. Goldstein (Eds.), **Self-Organizing Systems 1962**. Spartan Books.  
  Notes: Often cited as introducing a mass–energy bound on information processing rate.

### Margolus–Levitin bound (quantum speed limit for state evolution)
- Margolus, N., & Levitin, L. B. (1998). The maximum speed of dynamical evolution. **Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena**, 120(1–2), 188–195.  
  Notes: Derives a bound proportional to energy on the rate of orthogonal state transitions.

### Landauer principle (minimum thermodynamic cost per bit erasure)
- Landauer, R. (1961). Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process. **IBM Journal of Research and Development**, 5(3), 183–191.  
  Notes: Establishes the k_B T ln(2) lower bound on energy dissipation for irreversible bit erasure.
