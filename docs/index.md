# SHMF Documentation

This documentation is written in **technical scientific English** and is intended to be publication-adjacent:
assumptions are explicit, equations are defined, and claims are bounded.

## Sections

- [Assumptions](assumptions.md)
- [Mathematical Model](mathematical_model.md)
- [Physical Bounds](physical_bounds.md)
- [Falsifiability & Observables](falsifiability_observables.md)
- [Limitations](limitations.md)
- [Reproducibility](reproducibility.md)
- [References](../REFERENCES.md)

## Scope

SHMF provides reproducible computational primitives and a disciplined documentation layer for analyzing
the Simulation Hypothesis under explicit modeling assumptions. It does **not** claim proof of simulation.
